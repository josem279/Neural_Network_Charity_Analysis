# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create a binary clissifier capable of predicting the success of applicants that are funded by our company, Alphabet Soup. In order to create this classifier, we downloaded a large dataset, cleaned and preprocessed data, prepared and fitted neural networks, and then attempted to optimize our neural network by choosing to adjust one of the following: the number of neurons per hidden layer, the number of layers, the activation function for the hidden layers, or by adding additional epochs to the training regimen.
